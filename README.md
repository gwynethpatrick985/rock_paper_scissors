<h1> Rock Paper Scissors Project </h1>
<h3>Abstract:</h3> 
This is the front-end for a website for the game rock, paper, scissors. Additionally it plays a custom version with
original sprite work and 5 options: ghost, lawsuit, cursed dagger, stuffed bear, positive outlook. The score saves to and loads
from local storage. Users have the ability to delete this data. The game also allows you to return to the main menu and do a rematch
on the current mode. Have fun!

<h3>Context:</h3>
This project was created as part of a fundamentals of JS, CSS, and HTML course at Turing School of Software & Design.
The goal of the project was to use all the topics covered in a single project. This is a solo project, everything including
the assets (other than the font) were created by the owner of this repository.

<h3>Wins+Challenges</h3>

- I feel very proud of the visual design of the website, not only just the original sprite-work but also the fact that it looks
looks very clean even with the limited CSS knowledge I had at the point of writing this. I feel like the brevity with which
this was achieved and how easy it is to change key features with variables are things I can take pride in.
- One challenge I faced was initially having some disorganization in my function calls that I let get a bit out of hand before
  fixing. But I later solved this by reorganizing certain lines that reoccured into more convenient locations, and implementing a game board array
  to track the board state to simplify the event handlers associated with choosing moves, and the methods in the game class that use those choices.
<h3>Possible future extensions:</h3>

- A random move button in the options.
- A less bland backdrop.
- The ability to enter names for each player.
- Two player mode.
